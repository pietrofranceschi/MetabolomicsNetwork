The Italian Metabolomics Network aims to bring together people with different backgrounds actively working in the field of metabolomics, and more broadly in the study of metabolism.

The objective is to promote networking, by offering opportunities for discussion, collaboration, training and exchanges between the participants. 

The Network is open to everybody, no matter the research topic, the technique, the background, or the affiliation.
