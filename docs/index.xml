      <description>IMN is a home for all researchers doing metabolomics in Italy. The Network is open to everybody, no matter the research topic, or the technique used, or the professional level, or the scientific background, or the affiliation. If the investigation of the metabolome is part of your everyday work (and passion), then you are welcome to join!
The participation to the network is free.
We only ask you to actively participate and promote the activities of the Network.</description>
